# ASL Hand Sign Detection

This project implements real-time American Sign Language (ASL) hand sign detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. The model is trained to recognize ASL hand signs and make real-time predictions using a webcam.

## Features
- Real-time ASL hand sign detection using OpenCV.
- CNN-based model trained on ASL dataset.
- Pre-trained model (`asl.h5`) included for quick setup.
- Supports multiple hand gestures.
